# Disease Risk Predictor

üè• Disease Risk Predictor - Project Description
# üìã  Project Overview
A sophisticated web-based health assessment application that uses machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes risk based on patient medical data. The application features a complete authentication system with beautiful, modern UI design.

# üéØ Core Functionality
Authentication System
# User Registration:
Secure account creation with form validation

# User Login: 
Email/password authentication with session management

# Session Persistence:
Automatic login state preservation using localStorage

# Protected Routes: 
Dashboard access only for authenticated users

Risk Prediction Engine

# Multi-factor Analysis:
Evaluates 7+ health parameters including age, gender, glucose levels, BMI, blood pressure, diabetes pedigree, and medical history
Scoring Algorithm: Weighted scoring system that calculates risk probability
Risk Classification: Categorizes results as Low, Moderate, or High risk
Personalized Recommendations: Generates tailored health advice based on individual risk factors
